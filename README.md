# nearly-functional-python

This repository contains some ideas to make Python as nearly FP as possible, with some example code.

How functional can python be? Functional languages have:

* Immutable values and variables and complex types
* Functions should not have side-effects (modifying global state, performing I/O)
* Lazy evaluation
* Tail-call optimization
* Algebraic data types

So here are some things to try.

* Immutability
  * Use [frozendict](https://pypi.org/project/frozendict/),
    [frozenlist](https://pypi.org/project/frozenlist/),
    [frozenset](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=frozenset#frozenset),
    [frozen pydantic classes](https://docs.pydantic.dev/usage/model_config/).
  * Maybe write a
    [pylint checker](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/custom_checkers.html#write-a-checker)
    that detects variable reassignment.
* Typing
  * [Here is some advice](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md) on how to update
    legacy code with typing hints.
  * Use lots of [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) with
    ["mypy â€“strict"](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html),
    flake8, and [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for linting and to approximate static typing.
  * Use Python >= 3.10 to get pattern matching
    ([1](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3609208/how-to-use-structural-pattern-matching-in-python.html),
     [2](https://benhoyt.com/writings/python-pattern-matching/)) and also...
  * [Algebraic data types](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16258553)
* Iterators, lazy evaluation, etc
  * Read this [Pycon thing](https://pycon2019.trey.io/iterator-protocol.html) about lazy iterators.
  * Mess around with examples (map, filter, reduce, things I've seen done in OCaml or Haskell).
  * I'm not super familiar with lazy evaluation but it sounds very valuable. Some things about it...
    * Lazy evaluation is a technique that delays the evaluation of expressions until they are needed. This can be useful for improving performance and avoiding memory leaks.
    * [Lazy evaluation](https://wiki.c2.com/?LazyEvaluation)
    * [Why it's useful](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/265392/why-is-lazy-evaluation-useful)
    * [More about lazy evaluation](https://academic.udayton.edu/saverioperugini/courses/cps343/lecture_notes/lazyevaluation.html)
    * Maybe I'll have more to say about this when I understand it better.
* Tail call recursion
  * [It already exists](https://pypi.org/project/tail-recursive/). I just need to whip up a few examples.
* Memoization??

## FP advocacy

[Michael Clarkson](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/michael-clarkson) is a brilliant OCaml guy at Cornell
([textbook](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@MichaelRyanClarkson/videos))
who has done a lot of advocacy for FP. He is deeply rooted in its theory, history and underpinnings, but has a very
sensible rounded view of it. He is versed in the theory without getting lost in it. He understands why it's
important to write bullet-proof code in a world that needs a lot more bullet-proof code. He's smart and articulate
and a good writer and those videos represent a ton of work. In addition to the Cornell OCaml course he has also worked
on theorem provers, formally provable software correctness, [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), all that good stuff that
historically set the direction for FP.

## A few more random FP topics

* Currying is a technique that allows you to break down a function into functions that each take a single argument, more composable and reusable.
* Partial... *Python already does this.*
* Higher-order functions...
* Recursion...
* Pattern matching... *Probably belongs in the `typing` area.*
* Monads are a way of structuring code that can be used to implement many of the other functional programming idioms.
  They are a powerful tool that can be used to make code more concise, elegant, and correct.
